# BicycleRoadKorea

This package was made in participation of 2020 Rthon hosted by oss.kr
The event durated for 2 days, and we attempted to package publicly provided data with R.

It was originally designed to provide the following


*(1)* I/O module

Working our way through data preprocessing, we've realized that every institutions were expressing data in different ways. Some had more data than the other, and there were numerous occasions where same data were named differently. We intended to allow the users of our package to utilize this module and waver away from collecting data uniquely, and instead follow the way our data package was organized. 

*(2)* search module

We wanted to allow our users search and extract information about bicycle roads of the entire nation according to locations, length and road types (generally divided into bicycle only, with pedestrians and with cars)


*(3)* statistics module

Visualization functions for means and dispersion of data was what we intended to make for this module. 

## However, due to our lowly R skill and shortage of time, only the following is completed

*(1)* road.rda
This is a data table consisting of 38 manually (occasionally with R tricks) cleansed road information. However, the file is still pretty unstable as many of the rows miss numerous information. 

*(2)* half way through search module
It's half way through

*(3)* I/O module left unfinished
We've figured in midway that the I/O module we originally planned for unfits the main purpose of our package.

## All thanks to the mentors of oss.kr and team Croffle hopes to finish this package (sooner or ) later!
